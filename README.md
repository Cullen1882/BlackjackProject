# BlackjackProject

##Description
This is a BlackJack Game. The player is dealt two cards face up, the dealer is dealt one card up and one card down. The 
player and the dealer try to get as close to 21 without going over. The player is also trying to beat the score of the dealer
without surpassing a total of 21 for the cards in their hand. There are no options to make bets in this version and
there is no big and little ace in this version.

##Lessons Learned
The major takeaways that I had with this project were using more methods as well as passing them information and having 
them return some other information. I feel as though the use of methods kept my main much cleaner and saved me from having
to repeat certain blocks of code. Physically writing out the logic for the dealer and the player helped me look at my
approach to logic for this program, and others, in a much more granular fashion. The process of putting pen to paper
when planning my logic was necessary for this project in order to not overlook some very nuanced steps.
